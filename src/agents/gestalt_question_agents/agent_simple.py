    Generate a formatted `question.html` file using established HTML conventions,
    grounded in examples retrieved from the Question HTML vectorstore.

    This tool takes a **complete, finalized natural-language question** and a flag
    indicating whether the question is **Adaptive** or **non-adaptive**.

    It returns TWO things:
    1. A fully formatted `question.html` file that follows the platform’s
       structural, semantic, and stylistic conventions.
    2. The set of retrieved reference documents used to guide the formatting
       and structure (for grounding, inspection, or debugging).

    When presenting results to the end user, you MAY display **only** the generated
    `question.html` content. The retrieved documents are provided for internal
    reference and should not be surfaced unless explicitly requested.

    Use this tool when:
    - You are converting a finalized question stub into `question.html`.
    - You need grounded examples to ensure correct HTML structure and layout.
    - You want to follow existing input, panel, and markup conventions exactly.

    The retrieved examples MUST guide the formatting of the output, but MUST NOT
    be copied verbatim. The final HTML should be original, clean, and ready for
    direct use in the educational system.

    Generate a fully structured `solution.html` file that presents the
    step-by-step solution and final answer for a question.

    This tool takes a **complete `question.html` file** as its primary

    platform-compliant `solution.html` that:
    - Explains the reasoning and steps required to solve the question
    - Uses variables, symbols, and structure defined in `question.html`
    - Produces a solution suitable for adaptive or non-adaptive execution

    Optional Server File:
    - A `server_file` may be provided when the question uses server-side logic
      to generate parameters, values, or intermediate results.
    - The server file is treated as the **source of truth** for generated
      values and naming conventions.
    - When provided, the solution HTML must reference and remain consistent
      with the outputs, variables, and semantics defined by the server file.
    - The solution HTML MUST NOT reimplement or duplicate server-side logic.

    Adaptive Behavior:
    - If `isAdaptive=True`, the solution is written symbolically and generically
      so it remains valid across different parameter realizations.
    - If `isAdaptive=False`, the solution may include concrete values and
      explicit computations.

    - The solution must align structurally and semantically with the question.
